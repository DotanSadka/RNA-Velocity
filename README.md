Our project aims to utilize RNA velocity to identify cells that interact with others, such as immune cells with cancer cells, by correlating velocity-derived separation with cell locations in space. We plan to enhance and update our code to make it suitable for broader application across various tissues and larger datasets, potentially adding parameters as needed for optimization. Currently, our analyses were conducted on genomic data from a biopsy of one breast cancer patient, which may account for the lack of statistical significance. To address this, we intend to expand our analysis to include a wider range of tissues and cell types.
