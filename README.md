Immunotherapy engages the immune system against cancer tumors. However, predicting whether the treatment will work or not remains a challenge.�We aim to use RNA velocity to detect interactions between cells, specifically between immune cells and cancer cells, by linking RNA velocity which calculate the future state of the cells to the physical locations of cells in the tissue measured using Expansion Sequencing (ExSeq), Dr. Alon's lab solution to precise in situ transcriptomics – revealing RNA location inside and outside the nucleus.�Combining the two methods might hopefully estimate interaction between immune cells and tumor cells.
